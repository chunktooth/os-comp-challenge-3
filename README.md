## About
A social networking platform for Earth Lovers to connect and work on campaigns they're passionate about

## Color Palette and Background
The background is taken from Internation Space Station-43 permitted for non-commercial use. Using transparent layer over background to carry out the view of Earth. The colors used resemble Earth's atmosphere and the control panels repeated seen within the station.

## Challenges
When reducing screen width, top nav bar border overlaps with buttons float on the right side, also getting the buttons and the search bar to align without space in between. I find stacking elements in this comp particularly more challenging than previous projects in the past due to many elements within.

## Wins
Discovered ```border-collapse: collapse``` so that the table's borders do not a gap in between two different table datas. Got some basic understanding of the donut chart. The elements with icons centered inside have small gaps in between them, so I had to add code snippet
