## About
A social networking platform for Earth Lovers to connect and work on campaigns they're passionate about

## Color Palette and Background
The background is taken from Internation Space Station-43 permitted for non-commercial use. Using transparent layer over background to carry out the view of Earth. The colors used resemble Earth's atmosphere and the control panels repeatedly seen within the station.

## Challenges
When reducing screen width, top nav bar border overlaps with buttons floated on the right side. It took a long time to get the buttons and the search bar to align without space in between. I find stacking and flexing elements in this comp particularly more challenging than previous projects in the past due to many elements within.

## Wins
Discovered ```border-collapse: collapse``` so that the table's bottom borders don't leave a gap in between two different table datas. Got to learn how to put together donut charts. The elements with icons centered inside on top right cornor have small gaps in between them, so instead of using ```display: inline-block``` I had to add code snippet ```display: block, float: right```. Also found out that to center an image inside a button, use ```position: relative``` then adjust top and bottom pixels accordingly
